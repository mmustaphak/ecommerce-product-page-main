## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned
- I learnt how to implement the stripe library into the project.
- I also implement some basic animation for the first time.
- I also learnt how to handle events in React

### Continued development

This Project has shown me a lot of areas I get to improve on. I'm looking forward to learning more about transitions and animations in css as well as routing in reactJS using the react router library. I'm also looking forward to testing out other tools such as bootstrap and SCSS in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Triggering only parents onclick event](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-onclick-only-parent) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Event bubbling and capturing in React](https://blog.logrocket.com/event-bubbling-capturing-react/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how javascript handles event propagation. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
